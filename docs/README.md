# Stargate Documentation

Stargate is a library supporting the creation of HTTP based RESTful APIs. It's
built on top of Teapot and Zinc, providing a conceptual framework to simplify
the creation of RESTful APIs including:

- HATEOAS
- Content negotiation
- API versioning
- ETags
- Pagination
- Operations

To learn about the project, [install it](how-to/how-to-load-in-pharo.md) and
[start an API including the examples](how-to/how-to-startup-API.md).

Once you grasped the basics, lookup for details in the reference docs:

- [Controllers](reference/Controllers.md)
- [Operations](reference/Operations.md)
- [CORS](reference/CrossOriginResourceSharing.md)

or expand your understanding over specific topics:

- [What happens when a request is received?](explanation/Architecture.md)
